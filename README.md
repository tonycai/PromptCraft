# PromptCraft

A comprehensive web-based framework for assessing and evaluating "prompting proficiency" in technical interviews - the ability to effectively instruct AI language models for code generation.

## Overview

PromptCraft is designed for technical interviewers and hiring managers who want to evaluate a candidate's ability to leverage AI tools effectively. In an era where Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, the bottleneck is shifting towards the human's capacity to articulate clear, specific, and intelligent instructions. PromptCraft provides a structured approach to assess this critical skill.

## Project Vision

We envision PromptCraft as a versatile and extensible tool that enables technical interviewers to:

- Design targeted code generation tasks that probe different aspects of prompting ability
- Objectively evaluate a candidate's prompts based on clarity, specificity, and technical understanding
- Gain insights into a candidate's problem-solving approach when interacting with AI
- Identify candidates who can effectively collaborate with AI to enhance productivity and code quality

## Core Components

The PromptCraft workflow consists of the following components:

1. **ÈùàÊÑü (Inspiration)** - Gathering ideas for effective assessment tasks
2. **Â∞çË´áÈúÄÊ±Ç (Dialogue Requirements)** - Defining the prompt-based interaction parameters
3. **Áî®Êà∂ÊïÖ‰∫ã (User Stories)** - Identifying key personas and their needs
4. **È©óÊî∂Ê®ôÊ∫ñ (Acceptance Criteria)** - Establishing clear evaluation metrics
5. **Á∑®ÂØ´Á®ãÂºè (Program Development)** - Implementing the assessment framework
6. **Ê∏¨Ë©¶Á®ãÂºè (Program Testing)** - Validating the functionality and effectiveness
